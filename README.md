# Soil Classification using Deep Learning

This project focuses on classifying different types of soil using images of soil samples and a deep learning model. The goal is to train a model that can predict the soil type based on the features extracted from these images.

## Introduction
Soil classification is essential for agriculture, construction, and environmental analysis. This project aims to automate soil classification by utilizing deep learning techniques. Given a soil sample image, the model predicts its type (e.g., sandy, clay, loamy, etc.).

## Features
- Image-based soil classification using deep learning.
- Trained on a dataset of soil sample images.
- Provides an easy-to-use web interface for soil image classification.
- Flask-based backend for handling model inference.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of labelled soil sample images. The images are categorized into different soil types (e.g., clay, sand, loam). You can download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) or use a custom dataset.
